# Research Methodology: Verbalized Sampling Strategy

**Context:** Step 1c - Research Domain in skill creation workflow

**Purpose:** Generate and execute diverse research strategies to understand domain comprehensively using Verbalized Sampling (VS)

**Key Benefits:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **1.6-2.1Ã— diversity gain** vs standard research
- ðŸ” Explores non-obvious valuable angles (tail sampling p<0.10)
- ðŸ“Š Probability-weighted strategy selection
- âš¡ Research-backed skill proposals (not assumptions)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use This Methodology

### ALWAYS Offer Research When:
- âœ… Domain unfamiliar to Claude (not in pre-training knowledge)
- âœ… User requirements vague or minimal (<50 words description)
- âœ… Domain with rapid change (social media, AI tools, trends)
- âœ… Security-sensitive or complex domains
- âœ… User explicitly requests comprehensive understanding

### MAY Skip Research When:
- âš ï¸ Domain standard and familiar (PDF processing, markdown formatting)
- âš ï¸ User provides detailed specification (>200 words with clear structure)
- âš ï¸ User explicitly says "I know exactly what I need, skip research"

**Default stance:** ALWAYS OFFER research - let user decide

## ðŸ”¬ VS Research Strategy Generation

### Phase 1: Generate Diverse Research Strategies (INTERNAL)

**VS Prompt Template (Agent-Layer Only):**

```markdown
INTERNAL REASONING TASK:

Using Verbalized Sampling methodology, generate 5 diverse research query 
strategies for understanding [DOMAIN] skill creation.

Context:
- User wants to create skill for: [USER_TASK_DESCRIPTION]
- Domain appears: [familiar/unfamiliar/partially_known]
- User requirements clarity: [vague/moderate/detailed]

Instructions:
1. Sample from FULL distribution including non-obvious angles (p<0.15 acceptable)
2. Each strategy should explore DIFFERENT aspects
3. Estimate probability based on research value and relevance
4. Provide rationale using Chain-of-Thought reasoning

Required Aspects to Cover:
1. **Technical Implementation** (~p=0.30)
   - Standards, patterns, APIs, protocols
   - Common technical approaches and architectures
   - Best practices for implementation
   
2. **User Experience** (~p=0.25)
   - User pain points and workflows
   - Quality criteria users expect
   - Common user journeys and scenarios
   
3. **Competitive Analysis** (~p=0.20)
   - Existing tools and their approaches
   - Gaps in current solutions
   - Differentiation opportunities
   
4. **Edge Cases & Limitations** (~p=0.15)
   - Failure modes to anticipate
   - Platform-specific constraints
   - Non-obvious challenges
   
5. **Innovation & Trends** (~p=0.10)
   - Emerging trends in domain
   - Novel approaches worth exploring
   - Future-proofing considerations

Output Format (JSON):
```json
{
  "domain": "[DOMAIN]",
  "task_context": "[USER_TASK_DESCRIPTION]",
  "strategies": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "query": "specific web_search query (3-6 words optimal)",
      "probability": 0.XX,
      "aspect": "technical|user|competitive|edge|innovation",
      "rationale": "Chain-of-thought: Why this angle is valuable for [DOMAIN]. What insights it will provide. How it aligns with user needs.",
      "expected_insights": "What we expect to learn from this search"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "total_probability": 1.0,
    "diversity_score": "high|medium|low",
    "tail_inclusion": "count of strategies with p<0.15"
  }
}
```

Constraints:
- Probabilities MUST sum to ~1.0 (Â±0.05 acceptable)
- Queries optimized for web_search (3-6 words)
- Include current year (2025) for trend-dependent searches
- Favor diverse angles over redundant queries
- At least 1 tail strategy (p<0.15) for non-obvious insights
```

**Implementation Note:** This is INTERNAL prompt - user doesn't see this. Claude executes this reasoning internally to generate strategies.

---

### Phase 2: Strategy Execution (Top-N Selection)

**Execution Rules:**

```python
# Pseudo-code for execution logic
def execute_research_strategies(strategies):
    """
    Execute top strategies based on probability and time budget
    """
    # Sort by probability (highest first)
    sorted_strategies = sort(strategies, key='probability', reverse=True)
    
    # Execution rules
    to_execute = []
    
    # Always execute top 3
    to_execute.extend(sorted_strategies[0:3])
    
    # Execute 4th if p > 0.10 (meaningful probability)
    if len(sorted_strategies) >= 4 and sorted_strategies[3]['probability'] > 0.10:
        to_execute.append(sorted_strategies[3])
    
    # Execute 5th if p > 0.12 AND time allows (optional)
    if len(sorted_strategies) >= 5 and sorted_strategies[4]['probability'] > 0.12:
        to_execute.append(sorted_strategies[4])
    
    # Time budget: ~2-3 minutes total
    # Typical: 3-4 web_search calls
    
    return to_execute
```

**Execution Pattern:**

```bash
# Strategy 1 (Highest p - usually technical)
web_search(strategy_1.query)
# Expected: Technical standards, implementation patterns

# Strategy 2 (User-centric)
web_search(strategy_2.query)
# Expected: User pain points, workflow patterns

# Strategy 3 (Competitive/edge cases)
web_search(strategy_3.query)
# Expected: Existing solutions, gaps, opportunities

# Strategy 4 (If p>0.10 - innovation/trends)
if strategy_4.probability > 0.10:
    web_search(strategy_4.query)
    # Expected: Emerging trends, novel approaches
```

**Quality Check During Execution:**
- âš ï¸ If search returns insufficient results â†’ reformulate query
- âš ï¸ If results too generic â†’ add domain-specific terms
- âš ï¸ If aspect already well-covered â†’ skip redundant search

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Guidelines

### Adaptive Strategy Selection

```python
def adjust_research_depth(context):
    """
    Adjust research depth based on context
    """
    # Factors to consider
    domain_familiarity = context.get('familiarity')  # high|medium|low
    requirements_clarity = context.get('clarity')     # clear|moderate|vague
    domain_complexity = context.get('complexity')     # simple|moderate|complex
    
    # Decision logic
    if domain_familiarity == 'low' or requirements_clarity == 'vague':
        # MUST research thoroughly
        return {
            'strategies_count': 5,
            'execute_count': 4,
            'time_budget': '3-4 minutes'
        }
    
    elif domain_complexity == 'complex':
        # Research technical + edge cases
        return {
            'strategies_count': 5,
            'execute_count': 4,
            'time_budget': '2-3 minutes',
            'focus': ['technical', 'edge']
        }
    
    else:
        # Standard research
        return {
            'strategies_count': 5,
            'execute_count': 3,
            'time_budget': '2 minutes',
            'focus': ['technical', 'user', 'competitive']
        }
```

### Temperature Tuning

**Research strategy generation:**
- Temperature: **0.8-0.9** (encourage diverse angles)
- Reason: Want non-obvious strategies to emerge

**Web search execution:**
- Temperature: N/A (deterministic search)

**Findings synthesis:**
- Temperature: **0.7** (balanced, coherent)

---

## ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Strategies too similar** | Prompt not emphasizing diversity | Add "explore DIFFERENT aspects" + tail sampling instruction |
| **Probabilities all ~0.2** | Model defaulting to uniform | Use CoT: "Explain WHY this probability based on research value" |
| **Irrelevant search results** | Query too generic | Add domain-specific terms, current year |
| **Redundant findings** | Similar strategies executed | Validate uniqueness before execution |
| **Synthesis too verbose** | Over-documenting every detail | Focus on ACTIONABLE insights for Step 1d |
