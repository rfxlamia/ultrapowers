# Proposal Generation: Verbalized Sampling Strategy

**Context:** Step 1d - Propose Skill Structure in skill creation workflow

**Purpose:** Generate multiple structure proposals with probabilities, trade-offs, and recommendations using Verbalized Sampling (VS)

**Key Benefits:**
- Ã°Å¸Å½Â¯ **3-5 viable options** vs single proposal (user makes informed choice)
- Ã°Å¸â€œÅ  Probability-weighted recommendations based on research alignment
- Ã¢Å¡â€“Ã¯Â¸Â Explicit trade-offs for each approach
- Ã°Å¸â€Â Better fit discovery through comparison
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ Higher user confidence in final selection

---

## Ã°Å¸Å½Â¯ When to Use This Methodology

### ALWAYS Generate Multiple Proposals When:
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ Research reveals multiple viable approaches
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ User requirements allow flexibility
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ Domain has established alternative patterns
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ Trade-offs exist between token efficiency, complexity, flexibility

### MAY Generate Single Proposal When:
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â Research strongly indicates ONE optimal approach (rare)
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â User explicitly specifies exact structure desired
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â Constraints so tight that only one viable option exists

**Default stance:** Generate 3-5 proposals - let user choose best fit

## Ã°Å¸â€Â¬ VS Proposal Generation Strategy

### Phase 1: Generate Structure Proposals (INTERNAL)

**VS Prompt Template (Agent-Layer Only):**

```markdown
INTERNAL REASONING TASK:

Using Verbalized Sampling methodology, generate 3-5 skill structure proposals 
for [DOMAIN] based on research findings.

Context:
- Domain: [DOMAIN]
- User Task: [USER_TASK_DESCRIPTION]
- Research Summary:
  * Technical standards: [key findings]
  * User expectations: [key findings]
  * Competitive gaps: [key findings]
  * Complexity level: [low|medium|high]

Instructions:
1. Each proposal represents DIFFERENT design philosophy
2. Estimate probability based on research alignment + implementation fit
3. Calculate token estimates using progressive disclosure principles
4. Provide honest trade-offs (pros AND cons)
5. Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning for probability

Design Philosophies to Consider:

1. **Workflow-Based** (Sequential step-by-step process)
   - Best for: Linear processes, clear sequences
   - Structure: SKILL.md with step sections
   - Token pattern: Core workflow in main, details in references

2. **Task-Based** (Organized by use case/scenario)
   - Best for: Multiple distinct use cases, flexible entry points
   - Structure: SKILL.md with task sections per scenario
   - Token pattern: Task-specific guidance, shared references

3. **Reference-Heavy** (Minimal SKILL.md + comprehensive knowledge base)
   - Best for: Complex domains, extensive documentation needed
   - Structure: Thin SKILL.md orchestrator, detailed references
   - Token pattern: Extreme progressive disclosure

4. **Minimal Progressive** (Core only in SKILL.md, all details on-demand)
   - Best for: Simple domains, efficiency-critical
   - Structure: Compact SKILL.md (~150 lines), optional references
   - Token pattern: Optimal token efficiency

5. **Hybrid** (Combines multiple approaches strategically)
   - Best for: Complex requirements needing flexible structure
   - Structure: Mix of patterns where each fits
   - Token pattern: Balanced based on needs

Constraints:
- Probabilities MUST sum to ~1.0 (Ã‚Â±0.05 acceptable)
- All proposals must be VIABLE (no straw man options)
- Token estimates must follow progressive disclosure principles
- Trade-offs must be HONEST and SPECIFIC
- At least 3 proposals required, maximum 5
- Highest probability = best research alignment
```

**Implementation Note:** This is INTERNAL prompt - user doesn't see raw JSON. Claude processes this and presents formatted proposals to user.

### Token Budget Constraints (Enforced in Step 1f)

**CRITICAL: These constraints are enforced during execution planning (Step 1f)**

**Budget Rules:**
1. **Per-file limit:** Each reference file MAX 300 tokens (~37 lines)
2. **Total reference limit:** All references combined <= 70% of SKILL.md target tokens
3. **File count threshold:** If >8 reference files -> MUST reduce OR justify

**Why These Constraints:**
- Prevents "plan 14 files, create only 3" problem identified in testing
- Forces focused content in fewer, substantial files
- Ensures token budget known before creation starts
- Enables priority system (P0/P1/P2) to work effectively

**Calculation Example:**
```
SKILL.md target: 2000 tokens (250 lines)
Reference budget: 2000 * 0.70 = 1400 tokens max

If proposal has 14 reference files at 300 tokens each:
- Planned: 14 * 300 = 4200 tokens
- Budget: 1400 tokens
- PROBLEM: 3x over budget!

Solution (applied in Step 1f):
- Assign priorities: 4 P0 + 3 P1 + 7 P2
- P0 (critical, must complete): 4 * 300 = 1200 tokens
- P1 (important, minimum): 3 * 120 = 360 tokens (reduced scope)
- P2 (optional, placeholder): 7 * 0 = 0 tokens
- Total: 1200 + 360 = 1560 tokens (within budget if optimized)
```

**Priority Assignment Guidelines:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Core workflows, essential APIs, must-have references
  - Requirement: >=80 lines substantial content
  - Cannot proceed without these files
- **P1 (Important):** Supporting docs, helpful guides, nice-to-have
  - Requirement: >=40 lines minimum content
  - Warn if missing but allow proceed
- **P2 (Optional):** Future enhancements, edge cases, advanced topics
  - Requirement: Placeholder "# TBD" acceptable
  - Explicitly allowed to be stubs

**Impact on Proposal Generation:**
When generating proposals in Phase 1, consider:
1. Estimate realistic token counts per reference file
2. If total references exceed 70% budget -> flag in proposal
3. Suggest priority levels in structure planning
4. Prefer 3-6 substantial files over 10+ planned files

    else:
        token_score = 0.10  # Needs optimization
    
    # Criterion 3: User Requirements Match (20%)
    requirements_score = 0.0
    
    covered_requirements = count_covered_requirements(proposal, user_requirements)
    requirements_score = (covered_requirements / total_requirements) * 0.20
    
    # Criterion 4: Implementation Complexity (15%)
    complexity_score = 0.0
    
    effort = proposal['implementation_notes']['estimated_effort']
    if effort < 2:  # hours
        complexity_score = 0.15  # Quick to implement
    elif effort < 4:
        complexity_score = 0.12  # Moderate
    else:
        complexity_score = 0.08  # Complex
    
    # Total probability
    probability = research_score + token_score + requirements_score + complexity_score
    
    # Normalize if needed
    return min(probability, 0.95)  # Cap at 0.95 to allow alternatives

### Pattern 2: Modification Request

```markdown
User: "Option A is good but I want to combine the efficiency of Option C"

Claude Response:
ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Understood! Creating **hybrid proposal**: Task-Based + Minimal Progressive

Ã°Å¸â€œâ€¹ Adjusted Structure:
```
instagram-caption-skill/
Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ SKILL.md (~160 lines) Ã¢â€ Â Reduced from 200
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Overview (15 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Quick Task Guide (25 lines) Ã¢â€ Â New: task decision matrix
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Core Generation Logic (120 lines) Ã¢â€ Â Consolidated tasks
Ã¢â€â€š
Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ references/
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ task-product-launch.md (~60 lines) Ã¢â€ Â Separated
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ task-storytelling.md (~60 lines) Ã¢â€ Â Separated
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ task-engagement.md (~60 lines) Ã¢â€ Â Separated
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ brand-voice-guide.md (~80 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ hashtag-strategy.md (~100 lines)
```

Ã°Å¸â€œÅ  Updated Token Efficiency:
- SKILL.md: ~1,600 tokens (vs 2,000)
- Typical load: ~2,000 tokens (vs 2,500) - **20% improvement** Ã¢Å“â€¦
- Full load: ~4,600 tokens (more references but on-demand)

Ã¢Å“â€¦ Maintained Benefits:
- Task-specific optimization (now in separate references)
- Improved token efficiency (minimal core)
- Progressive disclosure (load task reference when needed)

Ã¢Å¡â€“Ã¯Â¸Â New Trade-off:
- Pro: More efficient, better progressive disclosure
- Con: User must load task reference (but most will only use 1-2 tasks)

Does this hybrid approach meet your needs?
```

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Request

```markdown
User: "Combine A's task organization with B's sequential workflow"

Claude Response:
ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Creating **Task-Based Workflow Hybrid**

Ã°Å¸â€™Â¡ Design Concept:
- Task sections (from A) for flexibility
- Sequential steps within each task (from B) for clarity

Ã°Å¸â€œâ€¹ Hybrid Structure:
```
instagram-caption-skill/
Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ SKILL.md (~220 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Overview & Task Selection (20 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Task 1: Product Launch
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Step 1: Brief Ã¢â€ â€™ Hook Ã¢â€ â€™ Body Ã¢â€ â€™ Hashtags (40 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Optimization tips
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Task 2: Storytelling  
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Step 1: Brief Ã¢â€ â€™ Hook Ã¢â€ â€™ Body Ã¢â€ â€™ Hashtags (40 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Narrative techniques
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€š
Ã¢â€â€š   Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Task 3: Engagement
Ã¢â€â€š       Ã¢â€Å“Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Step 1: Brief Ã¢â€ â€™ Hook Ã¢â€ â€™ Body Ã¢â€ â€™ Hashtags (40 lines)
Ã¢â€â€š       Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ Question frameworks
Ã¢â€â€š
Ã¢â€â€Ã¢â€â‚¬Ã¢â€â‚¬ references/ (same as Option A)
```

Ã¢Å“â€¦ Benefits from Both:
- Task flexibility (Option A) - choose your use case
- Step clarity (Option B) - clear process per task
- Best of both worlds

Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â Honest Trade-off:
- Slightly longer SKILL.md (~220 vs 200 lines)
- Some repetition of steps across tasks
- But: Clear and comprehensive guidance

Ã°Å¸â€œÅ  Token Estimate: ~2,800 tokens typical

Proceed with this hybrid?
```

---

### Pattern 4: Uncertainty / Questions

```markdown
User: "Not sure between A and B... which is better for beginners?"

Claude Response:
Great question! Let me highlight the key differences:

| Aspect | Option A (Task-Based) | Option B (Workflow) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate - need to choose task | Easier - just follow steps |
| **Flexibility** | High - jump to relevant section | Low - must follow sequence |
| **Use Case** | "I need product launch caption" | "Walk me through caption creation" |
| **Best For** | Experienced users who know goal | Beginners learning the process |

Ã°Å¸Å½Â¯ **Recommendation for Beginners:**
**Option B (Workflow-Based)** is better because:
1. Clear linear process - no decisions needed
2. Learn by doing - each step teaches something
3. Easier first experience - hand-holding approach

**However**, once they're comfortable, they may prefer Option A for speed.

Ã°Å¸â€™Â¡ **Alternative Idea:**
Start with Option B (workflow), then add Task-Based quick reference later as users get comfortable. This provides "training wheels" that can be removed.

Would you like to:
- Choose Option B (beginner-friendly)
- Use hybrid approach (workflow + task shortcuts)
- Start with B, plan to add A features later
```

## Ã°Å¸â€œÂ Quality Validation

### Proposal Quality Checklist

Before presenting to user, verify each proposal:

- [ ] **Viability:** Structure is implementable (not theoretical)
- [ ] **Token Accuracy:** Estimates calculated using line-count method
- [ ] **Trade-offs Honest:** Includes real disadvantages, not just pros
- [ ] **Research Aligned:** Claims match actual research findings
- [ ] **Differentiation:** Proposals genuinely different (not minor variations)
- [ ] **Completeness:** All required sections specified
- [ ] **Probability Justified:** CoT reasoning provided

**Red Flags:**
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â All probabilities ~0.33 (uniform) Ã¢â€ â€™ Likely not truly evaluated
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â No disadvantages listed Ã¢â€ â€™ Unrealistic, not honest
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â Identical structures with minor tweaks Ã¢â€ â€™ Not diverse enough
- Ã¢Å¡Â Ã¯Â¸Â Token estimates wildly different from similar patterns Ã¢â€ â€™ Recalculate

---

## Ã°Å¸Å½Â¯ Optimization Guidelines

### Adaptive Proposal Count

```python
def determine_proposal_count(research_results, domain_complexity):
    """
    Decide how many proposals to generate
    """
    # Factors
    viable_approaches = count_viable_approaches(research_results)
    clear_winner = has_clear_winner(research_results)
    user_constraints = get_constraints_count()
    
    # Decision logic
    if clear_winner and user_constraints > 3:
        return 2  # Clear winner + one alternative
    
    elif viable_approaches <= 2:
        return 2  # Only 2 genuinely different approaches
    
    elif domain_complexity == 'high':
        return 5  # More options for complex domains
    
    else:
        return 3  # Standard: 3 proposals
```

### Temperature Tuning

**Proposal generation:**
- Temperature: **0.7-0.8** (balanced, coherent structures)
- Reason: Want viable proposals, not wild experimentation

**Probability estimation:**
- Temperature: **0.6** (conservative, accurate)
- Reason: Probability should be calculated, not creative

---

## Ã°Å¸Å¡Â¨ Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Proposals too similar** | Not exploring diverse philosophies | Explicitly assign different philosophy to each |
| **Unrealistic token estimates** | Guessing vs calculating | Use line count: ~10 tokens/line formula |
| **All pros, no cons** | Avoiding honest trade-offs | Required: At least 2 disadvantages per proposal |
| **Probabilities don't sum to 1.0** | Math error or normalization issue | Post-process: normalize probabilities |
| **User can't decide** | Proposals not differentiated enough | Add comparison table, decision guide |

## Ã°Å¸Å½â€œ Learning & Improvement

**After each proposal session, track:**

1. **Selection Patterns:**
   - Which proposals most commonly selected?
   - Do users prefer task-based or workflow-based?
   - Are hybrid requests frequent?

2. **Probability Accuracy:**
   - Did highest probability match user choice?
   - Were probabilities well-calibrated?

3. **Trade-off Effectiveness:**
   - Did honest cons help decision-making?
   - Were any cons deal-breakers?

4. **Modification Frequency:**
   - How often do users request modifications?
   - What aspects most commonly modified?

**Feedback Loop:**
- Refine probability weighting based on patterns
- Adjust proposal templates for common hybrids
- Update trade-off categories based on user feedback
